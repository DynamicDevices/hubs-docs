## Subscription Tiers

### [Hubs Early Access (EA)](https://hubs.mozilla.com/#subscribe)

Launched in November 2022, Hubs Early Access makes it easier to customize Hubs without the hassle of configuring a server and database. Hubs EA gives you access to the subscription dashboard, scene editor, and admin panel, where you can easily manage the worlds, avatars, and default features of your Hub. Hubs EA is perfect for creators, educators, and event hosts building experiences without access to technical resources, like a 3D developer.

| EA Specifications |                               |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Worlds            | Unlimited                     |
| Concurrent Users  | 25                            |
| Asset Storage     | 2 GB                          |
| Domain            | Custom myhubs.net web address |
