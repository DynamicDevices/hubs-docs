_Hubs currently offers two managed subscription plans that allow users to customize the default behavior of their hub and manage content, such as virtual worlds and avatars, without the hassle of running their own server. If you are not ready to sign up for a plan, you can create a [default room](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) or [custom scene](https://hubs.mozilla.com/spoke) for free on Mozilla's Demo Hub. If you are interested in having more customization or deploying custom code, check out [Hubs Cloud](./hubs-cloud-intro.html)._
