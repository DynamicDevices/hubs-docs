## Cancelling Your Subscription

You can cancel your subscription to Hubs at any time. Cancelling your Hubs subscription will turn off auto-renew and the Hubs subscription features will stop working when your current subscription period ends. Once your subscription period has ended, you will lose all access to your Hub's data, so be sure to save any desired assets before this period ends. Cancelling your subscription will not delete your Firefox account.

1. **Visit your subscription settings on the [Firefox accounts page](https://subscriptions.firefox.com/subscriptions).**
